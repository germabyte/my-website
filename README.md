# Personal Website

This GitHub repository contains the code for a personal website that simulates a command-line terminal interface. Users can interact with the website by entering commands and receiving responses in a terminal-like fashion. Below is an overview of how the website works:

## Features

- **Command Line Interface:** The website provides a command-line interface that allows users to enter commands.

- **Simulated Terminal:** Responses to commands are displayed in a simulated terminal window, providing a familiar look and feel.

- **Commands:** Several commands are supported, including `ls`, `open`, `whoami`, `date`, `help`, `clear`, `reboot`, and more. Each command serves a specific purpose and provides information or performs an action when executed.

- **File Access:** Users can use the `open` command to access predefined files and URLs. The website supports various file types, and clicking on a file or URL in the terminal opens it in a new tab.

- **Sidenav Menu:** A side navigation menu allows users to access predefined files and URLs by clicking on them. The menu can be expanded or collapsed as needed.

- **Profile Information:** User and host information is displayed in the terminal, giving a personalized touch to the interface.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to work on different screen sizes and devices.

## Usage

1. **Interacting with the Terminal:** Users can enter commands in the command-line input field and press Enter to execute them. The terminal will display the output of the executed command.

2. **Navigating Files:** Users can access predefined files and URLs using the `open` command or by clicking on them in the side navigation menu.

3. **Exploring Commands:** The `help` command provides information about available commands and their usage.

4. **Clearing the Terminal:** The `clear` command clears the terminal screen.

5. **Rebooting:** The `reboot` command simulates a system reboot.

6. **Sudo (Superuser) Mode:** The `sudo` command informs users that it cannot be executed in a web client, adding a humorous touch.
